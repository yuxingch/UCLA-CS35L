1. dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
The result is:
openssh-client                                  install
So I try:
   sudo apt-get intall openssh-server

Then I check by using:
$ dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
openssh-client				install
openssh-server				install
openssh-sftp-server			install

2. As a server:
(1) Generate public and private keys
$ ssh-keygen
Set the password as 12345

Your identification has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:zlhd4X8uemyiafjz7CHhNDXHy5ScCtyLR/9MWHwL0lk ubuntu@ubuntu
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|            .  E |
|         . o.+o+ |
|          o.B+B +|
|         . *.X.+o|
|        S * + *.o|
|       = o +   * |
|      . o.o ... +|
|        . o+.o+. |
|         o+==+   |
+----[SHA256]-----+

(2) Create an account for the client on the server

sudo useradd -d /home/xx -m xxxxx
sudo passwd xxxxx

set the password as 0517

(3) Create .ssh directory for new user

cd /home/xx
sudo mkdir .ssh

(4) Change ownership and permission on .ssh directory

sudo chown -R xxxxx .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

(5) Check my IP address
ifconfig
10.97.85.71

(6) Optional:
sudo apt-get install emacs24
sudo emacs /etc/ssh/sshd_config
and I change "yes" into "no"

(7)
My client touch a new file named "test" under /home/xx directory, and I check
under the same directory:
ubuntu@ubuntu:/home/xx$ ls
examples.desktop  test
If I check the creating time:
-rw-rw-r-- 1 xxxxx xxxxx    0 Feb 11 12:57 test

3. As a client:
(1) Copy my public key to the server for key-based authentication.
ssh-copy-id -i classxxx@10.97.85.64

(2) Add private key to authentication agent
ssh-add

(3) SSH to server
ssh classxxx@10.97.85.64
ssh -X classxxx@10.97.85.64

(4)
And I check by using:
    touch hi
My host can also see this file in her terminal.

Then I use:
    xterm
    firefox
And they work well.
