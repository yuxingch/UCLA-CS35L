Q1: Why did Brady's patch remove the line "case_long_iso_time_style:"? Was it
necessary to remove that line? Explain.

A: It was not necessary to remove that line, since we also removed:
"if (locale_format == long_time_format[i])
    goto case_long_iso_time_style;"
It no longer needs "case_long_iso_time_style:" to compile the file since it
will never be executed. 

Q2: If your company adopts this patched version of Coreutils instead of the
default one, what else should you watch out for? Might this new version of
Coreutils introduce other problems with your application, perhaps in countries
where users don't speak English and don't understand English-format dates?

A:  We should watch out for the non-English locales which might cause problems.
    Also, we should consider if this patch can satisfy majority of users.
    In countries where user's don't speak English and don't understand
    English-format dates, people may not understand the date, since they
    may not know which month it is.

Q3: What happens when this script is invoked on an empty file like /dev/null,
and why?

A: arbitrary empty file:
   emacs empty
   ./randline.py  -n 4 empty

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "./randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "./randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is
    empty
  IndexError: list index out of range

  Use /dev/null: same result

  Because it cannot random a line if there is no content in the file.

Q4: What happens when this script is invoked with Python 3 rather than Python 2
, and why? (You can run Python 3 on the SEASnet hosts by using the command
python3 instead of python.)

File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                          ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Reason: Because python3 and python2 are different in some ways. It becomes
invalid syntax in python3.
