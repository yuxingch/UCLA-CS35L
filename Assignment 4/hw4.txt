2. enter into diffutils directory
   #	 Check out version 3.0 of Diffutils into a new branch named
   git checkout -b quote v3.0
   Switched to a new branch 'quote'

3. patch under this directory: ~/35L/week4/copy/diffutils
   patch -p1 < ~/35L/week4/gitroot/diffutils/quote-3.0-patch.txt

and there are 6 patching files:
    patching file src/cmp.c
    patching file src/diff.c
    patching file src/diff3.c
    patching file src/dir.c
    patching file src/sdiff.c
    patching file src/util.c

5. emacs src/cmp.c
   C-x 4 a
   C-x C-f
and I write "change all "`" to "'" "

6. commit changes to the new branch
   git add .
   git commit -F ./src/ChangeLog

7. git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patched.txt

8. My partner is xxx (UID:xxx)
   git checkout -b partner v3.0
   git am < ~/35L/week4/copy/formatted-patch.txt

   Then I apply following steps:
   ./bootstrap
   cd lib
  wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter16/cs35L/assign/diffutils-gets.diff
  patch -p1 < diffutils-gets.diff
  cd ..
  ./configure
  make
  make check
  diff . -
  diff --help

9. make distdir
It create a new directory called "diffutils-3.0.1-7840" under diffutils
emacs diffutils*/ChangeLog
The content in this file is the same as my ChangeLog.

10.  First I download and install XQuartz from website.
ssh -X classxxx@lnxsrv01.seas.ucla.edu
export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
cd emacs
gitk
Then I take a screenshot.
