1. man -k keyword

2. use which keyword
   which cp
   /usr/local/cs/bin/cp
   which wc
   /usr/local/cs/bin/wc

3. find /usr/bin -name ? -executable
result:
   /usr/bin/[
   /usr/bin/w
   /usr/bin/X
   w: display who is logged in and what they are doing
   X: a portable, network-transparent window system
   [: no manual for [

4. I use readlink:
   readlink /usr/bin/emacs
   Actually executed: /etc/alternatives/emacs

5. g+s: 
     g - gives permissions to the members of the file’s group
     s - sets user ID or group ID on execution
     Sets group ID on execution to the members of the file’s group
   o-x: deny executable permissions to others

6. -mtime -21
   (I use “man find” to find corresponding command)

7. find . -type d -mtime -21

8. which find
   cd /usr/bin
   find . -type l | wc -l
   241 (on server 07)

9. cd /usr/lib
   ls -lat
   I get: kbd

10. 
locale command gets data from environment variables (localedef).

11. I use: C-h a sort Enter and copy the results.
Buffer-menu-sort	      M-x ... RET
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column at point.
sort-columns		      M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region alphabetically by a certain range of columns.
sort-fields		      M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region lexicographically by the ARGth field of each
   line.
sort-lines		      M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-numeric-fields	      M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region numerically by the ARGth field of each line.
sort-pages		      M-x ... RET
   Sort pages in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-paragraphs		      M-x ... RET
   Sort paragraphs in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-regexp-fields	      M-x ... RET
   Sort the text in the region region lexicographically.
tabulated-list-col-sort	      M-x ... RET
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column of the mouse click E.
tabulated-list-sort	      M-x ... RET
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column at point.

12. To find out what these keystrokes do, I use: C-h b and find them in the
list.
    C-M-a: begining-of-defun
           Move backward to the beginning of a defun.
    C-M-b: backward-sexp
           Move backward across one balanced expression (sexp).
    C-M-c: exit-recursive-edit
           Exit from the innermost recursive edit or minibuffer.
    C-M-d: down-list
           Move forward down one level of parentheses.
    C-M-e: end-of-defun
           Move forward to next end of defun.
    C-M-f: forward-sexp
           Move forward across one balanced expression (sexp).
    C-M-g: 
    C-M-h: mark-defun
           Put mark at end of this defun, point at beginning.

13. C-g: it can abort partially typed or executing command in error recovery,
                abort current search in incremental search
                and abort command in the minibuffer.

14. C-h d yank
    yank
  Command: Reinsert ("paste") the last stretch of killed text.
  More precisely, reinsert the most recent kill, which is the stretch of
killed text most recently killed OR yanked. Put point at the end, and set
mark at the beginning without activating it.
  With just C-u as argument, put point at beginning, and mark at end.

15. When we use the directory listing of the Emacs dired command, there are
two more lines in the beginning part:
  dr-xr-xr-x.   2 root root       69632 Dec 22 13:15 .
  drwxr-xr-x.  15 root root        4096 Dec 22 10:48 ..
 The remaining lines seem to be the same.
